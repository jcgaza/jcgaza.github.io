Hello! _Kumusta?_

I write and teach code and research. I teach introductory programming and research to high school students in University of the Philippines Rural High School. I also handle some research projects related to combinatorial optimization, agent-based modeling, computer science education, and machine learning.

Previously writes code & fiction. I also happen to have three gorgeous feline children named Cookie, Mocha, and Jaya.
